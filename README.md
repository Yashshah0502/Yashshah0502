I'm a recent Master's grad in Information Technology from Arizona State University (GPA: 3.9), with a focus on **data analytics**, **automation**, and **full-stack development**. I love turning messy data into clear insights and building tools that actually solve problems.

Currently exploring roles in **Data Analytics**, **Business Intelligence**, or **Software Engineering**—open to freelance or full-time opportunities!
